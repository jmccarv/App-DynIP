DynIP - A simple Catalyst application to dynamically update a BIND
        server using nsupdate for clients with dynamically allocated IPs.

You will need to have your name server configured to allow updates via
the 'nsupdate' command.  See tutorials online for this.

Clients connect to the /client/update endpoint of this app to request an update.
See contrib/client for an example script

A client must authenticate itself by setting the X-Auth-Token header.
This token is used to determine if a client is allowed to update the server
and what record the client updates.

It is highly recommended you use SSL with this service, otherwise these tokens
will be in the clear!


There is also an /admin service for admin access.  Again, the X-Auth-Toekn
header must be set correctly to gain access to the /admin service.

There are the following endpoints under /admin:
  /admin/update
  /admin/delete

  /admin/update takes two parameters, a hostname and an IP for that hostname
  ex: /admin/update/darkstar/10.0.0.1

  /admin/delete takes one parameter, a hostname to delete:
  ex: /admin/delete/darkstar

Run script/dynip_server.pl to test the application.

Configuration for the application is done in the dynip.conf file in the root
of this distribution.  See that file for further details.
